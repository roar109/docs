## Why we fail so hard

- Know the goal and understand it. **Every team member should be aware of this**.
- Break down as much as possible to be clear in the goal. 
- Write it down. Minds memory is not a permanent storage for small details.
- Do not be afraid of change! doing things differently doesn't have to be a fearsome experience. Learning is a continuous and never-ending process that applies to individuals, teams and organizations; and it is the greatest tool for them to maintain their competitive advantage and ensures their survival and evolution.
- Do not be afraid to ask questions! working on agile/lean development requires a lot of communication as the only way to ensure that we are working on the right product. 
- Do not be afraid to challenge your Architect/PO! If you think a given solution is not the most efficient/practical/appropriate/etc. raise your hand and comment. If you have a better idea on how to solve any problem.. share it! discuss it with your teammates, this is the most important part of the collective knowledge construction process.
- Be proud of your job, it requires effort and time to do, things that are not free.
- Anything is better than nothing.

### What we can try ###

- Lego approach - glue parts together, add, remove but in the end we need something functional.
- Think in logical units of work, rather than releases or sprints.
